> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an **unofficial Slimefun Legacy compatibility fork** of InfinityExpansion2, developed for use on **albionmc.com**. It preserves the upstream IE2 rewrite while adding migration and safety work for established InfinityExpansion v1 worlds.

## ♾️ What does InfinityExpansion2 do?

InfinityExpansion2 is a large end-game Slimefun addon centered around advanced resources, high-tier machines, storage, automation, and Mob Simulation. It is the Kotlin rewrite in the Infinity Expansion project family.

This fork additionally focuses on helping existing servers move from **InfinityExpansion v1 (IE1)** to **InfinityExpansion2 (IE2)** without casually abandoning old item/block data.

Browse Mob Data Cards through **All Mobs / Passive / Neutral / Hostile / Boss** in the Slimefun guide. Choose alphabetical order (the default) or restore your card-file order with `mob-simulation.guide.sort-order: config`; `yaml` is also accepted. Every category can be shown or hidden independently, and explicit textures, names, and colors are preserved. See [guide sorting, categories, and card materials](docs/SMARTSPAWNER_CARDS.md#slimefun-guide-categories) for the settings to merge into your existing configuration, then restart the server.

## 🔄 IE1 → IE2 migration support

The maintained fork adds:

- placed-block migration from legacy IE1 IDs to IE2 IDs;
- item migration in player inventories, ender chests, vanilla containers, Slimefun machine menus, dropped items, displays/item frames, and entity equipment where supported;
- explicit mappings for renamed items plus normal `FOO → IE_FOO` compatibility mapping;
- migration for dynamic old MobSim cards and quarry oscillators;
- filled IE1 Storage Unit migration, including serialized stored-item data and old capacities;
- additional IE2 storage tiers matching historical IE1 capacity milestones;
- `/ie2 doctor` commands for status, scan, migration, and item/armor refresh;
- compatibility aliases for legacy records that are encountered after the first migration pass.

### Recommended migration process

1. Back up the complete server, worlds, Slimefun data/database, and plugin folders.
2. On a staging copy, run IE1 and this IE2 fork together for the initial migration pass where supported.
3. Run `/ie2 doctor status` and `/ie2 doctor scan`.
4. Load areas containing old IE1 machines/storage and run `/ie2 doctor migrate`.
5. Run another scan and perform a clean shutdown.
6. Remove IE1, keep IE2, restart, and scan again.
7. Test old storage, machines, Mob Simulation, items, armor, and unloaded/then-loaded chunks before production use.

See `docs/MIGRATION_IE1.md` for the detailed procedure and limitations.

## 🛡️ Slimefun Legacy maintenance

Additional compatibility/safety work includes:

- Slimefun Legacy as the primary Slimefun target;
- Paper 26.2 / Java 25 build/runtime support with Java 21 plugin bytecode;
- Mob Simulation power/output hardening and overflow-safe arithmetic;
- stacked-card product/XP handling and no XP-without-output behavior;
- item/armor template refresh while preserving durability, enchantments, trims, and non-conflicting persistent data;
- reflective isolation around Slimefun storage-controller implementation differences;
- CI, tagged releases, and upstream-sync review workflow;
- disabling the old runtime self-updater so it cannot replace this fork with an unrelated upstream binary.
